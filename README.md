# What is ADOP-Lite?
ADOP-Lite is the name given to adopting just the Cartridge loader into a pre-existing instance of Jenkins. ADOP-Lite enables Jenkins instances (that do not come pre-configured with the Load_Platform & adop-platform-management jobs) to load cartridges and benefit from multi-tenancy via workspaces & projects.

For many people using their own dedicated full instance of ADOP or using ADOP via the ADOP Enterprise SaaS service meets their needs.  However, not everyone is lucky enough to have control over creating/recreating the tooling instances. If you are tired to using a pre-existing Jenkins and do not have full control over your infrastructure, ADOP-LITEis your ticket to the wonderful world of Cartridges.

# Pre-requisites for getting into ADOP LITE
Mandatory
1. You must be interested in automating Jenkins jobs and reusing automation
2. You must have Jenkins in your tools platform
 
Optional
1. A Jenkins instance that meets the minimum specifications and either runs on Linux or has access to a slave running Linux.
2. Access to a cloud account so that you can re-use cartridges that create cloud resources.
3. Access to Docker so that you can re-use cartridges that use Docker
